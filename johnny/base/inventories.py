    together:

      [+1, +1, -1, -1]

      [+1, +1, -1, -1] --> [+1, -1], [-1, -1]

    This class maintains a list of lots to be matched against, and an active

    match-id gets reset. If a single transaction takes the position across the
    zero line, we preserve the match-id (this is an arbitrary decision). In
    addition, this class maintains cost basis.

    In constract to the simpler FifoInventory class above, this class will split
    matches when necessary. For example, if a position of -3 is matched against
    a position of +2, the result will be a closing of -2 and an opening of -1.
    The match id will be preserve across the flat line.

    Moreover, if the client knows that a transaction is opening or closing,
    dedicated methods are provided that will automatically synthetize
    transaction rows to correct for a missing initial position. This allows us
    to process partial transactions logs whereby the initial state of the log
    may not include existing positions.

    (More specifically: if the position is not of the right sign, we save the
    correction required at the front in order to make it right. For example, an
    opening position of +1 quantity assumes the current position is >= 0. If it
    is < 0, we bring it to 0. Ditto for closing with +1 quantity, opening with
    -1 quantity or closing with -1 quantity. We just fix it up and store the
    offset for later creation instead of returning an error.)

    In order for this class to be able to produce an arbitrary number of new
    rows, instead of requiring the client to process a return list, we call into
    an accumulator which the client provides to append new rows. This keeps the
    interface a little simpler.
