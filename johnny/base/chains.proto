// import, and is intended for the user to review and update, to confirm the
// current state of a chain's definition.
//
// A chain begins its life as `ACTIVE`, automatically identified and produced by
// heuristics. From there, if you close the position, it may move to `CLOSED`.
// When the chain is complete, it should be marked `FINAL` by the user (in which
// case it will never change or be matched against any new trades). Previously
// defined chains that have become invalid, due to, e.g. changes in the code, or
// otherwise, will be marked `IGNORE` in order to avoid deleting their dta.
//
// The chains list is used as input but also as output. Efforts are made to
// minimize diffs between them.

  // The `ids` from those chains will be pulled out but new transactions may be
  // matched against them. `auto_ids` will be ignored from the input, but it
  // will be updated in the output for the user to inspect, recreated from
  // scratch automatically on all further runs. These are produced for you to
  // look at and upgrade their status to `FINAL`. These are considered active
  // chains.

  // when it has been completed and need never be added or removed any more
